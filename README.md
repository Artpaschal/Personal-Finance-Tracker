# ðŸ’¸ Personal Finance Tracker Dashboard â€“ Excel
A comprehensive and interactive Personal Finance Tracker Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel. This project was inspired by a workshop session led by Freedom and hosted by Evergreen Digital Tech Solution. The aim was to enhance financial visibility using a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard design.

# Problem Statement

# Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
The data shared with me was already cleaned and ready.
I added helper columns to simplify calculations (e.g., Month, Month Number, Net Amount, etc.).
Ensured consistent formatting and data types.

2. Data Analysis
Created Pivot Tables to calculate:
Total Income & Expense
Category-wise breakdown
Monthly & Weekly trends
Net Savings
Finalized color themes, layout structure, and visual hierarchy.
Used custom icons and labels for intuitive understanding.

4. Dashboard Design
Built an interactive dashboard layout with:
Key Metrics Cards (Total Income, Expense, Savings)
Monthly and Monthly Trend Charts
Slicers for dynamic filtering (e.g., by Month)
Enhanced navigation and user flow using a clean, structured design.

# Key Highlights
Hands-on practice in combining design thinking with data analysis in Excel.
Focus on UX Design and Xperience â€“ alignment, hierarchy, icons, and color theory.
Dashboard is relatively useful for personal or educational use.
